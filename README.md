## üìå Project Overview

The project focuses on examining apps and user reviews from the Google Play Store using SQL for data exploration and Power BI for interactive dashboards. The objective is to extract actionable insights that can help app developers, businesses, and marketers understand the dynamics of mobile applications and user feedback.
